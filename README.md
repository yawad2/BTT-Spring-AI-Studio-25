## **🏗️ Project Overview**

This competition is part of the Break Through Tech AI program, in collaboration with the Algorithmic Justice League. It focuses on addressing a huge issue in modern day dermatology software tools: their underperformance for people with darker skin tones. In participating in this challenge, we aimed to leverage AI to help build a more accurate and equitable dermatology AI tool. 

The main objective of this competition was to train a machine learning model capable of running image classification to classify 21 different skin conditions across various skin tones.

## **📊 Data Exploration**

**Describe:**

* The dataset used is the data provided in Kaggle by AJL. It’s a subset of the FitzPatrick17 dataset, which is a collection of around 17,000 images depicting a variety of serious and cosmetic dermatologic conditions. 
Used the official Kaggle dataset containing labeled dermatology images and metadata (including Fitzpatrick skin type)
Explored class imbalance across both skin condition labels and skin tone categories
Visualized:
Label distribution
Skin tone distribution
Sample images per class
Correlation heatmaps and histogram
* Data exploration and preprocessing approaches
* Challenges and assumptions when working with the dataset(s)



**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Plots, charts, heatmaps, feature visualizations, sample dataset images
Histogram of class representations/ data distribution
Accuracy conditioned on fitzpatrick scale
Confusion Matrix

## **🧠 Model Development**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Model(s) used (e.g., CNN with transfer learning, regression models)

We built and trained a variety of different models, including ResNet50, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet. Our method with training all these models was building each slowly and saving them after a certain run of epochs, then downloading them to save the history of their training. We would load them in when we wanted to train them on more epochs to be efficient.  After doing this with all the models, we ensemble the models together as a means of comparing their use using both hard and soft voting methods. Soft voting combines and averages the predictions of the models and chooses the model with the highest average prediction. Hard voting simply chooses the model with the highest votes in the prediction. 

Ensembling ResNet50, EfficientNetB3, EffiecientNetB4, and DenseNet121 using hard voting yielded the best result and highest accuracy of our attempts. 

* Feature selection and Hyperparameter tuning strategies

* Training setup (e.g., % of data for training/validation, evaluation metric, baseline performance)
Our training setup was 80% training and 20% validation. We used F1-score as our evaluation metric. For our baseline performance we measured using deep learning models pre-trained on large image datasets.

## **📈 Results & Key Findings**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Performance metrics (e.g., Kaggle Leaderboard score, F1-score)
Kaggle Leaderboard score: We oscillated between 3rd and 4th place on our final submissions.

* How your model performed overall
* How your model performed across different skin tones (AJL)
* Insights from evaluating model fairness (AJL)

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools

## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**AJL challenge:**

As Dr. Randi mentioned in her challenge overview, “Through poetry, art, and storytelling, you can reach others who might not know enough to understand what’s happening with the machine learning model or data visualizations, but might still be heavily impacted by this kind of work.”
As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.
Check out [this guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYKaVNR\_l7Abx2kebs3AdDi6TlPviC3q/view) from the Algorithmic Justice League for inspiration!

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
We tried to use data augmentation to balance the training samples of different skin tones. We also looked at model fairness using separate validation across the different skin tones.
2. What broader impact could your work have?
It could help improve dermatology for underrepresented skin tones which can translate into ethical issues? in healthcare.
//idk how i feel about issues here

## **🚀 Next Steps & Future Improvements**

**Address the following:**

* What are some of the limitations of your model?


* What would you do differently with more time/resources?

We would potentially try using a CNN model that had not previously been trained on the ImageNet dataset. In doing so, we would be able to rescale the AJL dataset to be smaller sizes, and manipulate the CNN layers as necessary, as well as run for more epochs. This would potentially give us more flexibility and more efficiency in runtime. 

* What additional datasets or techniques would you explore?


Collect or incorporate external datasets with better representation of darker skin tones
Experiment with GAN-based image augmentation to synthetically balance rare classes
